## 01.01.
Write a program in any programming language (C/C++, C#, Python, â€¦) to implement the following pseudocode: 

```
Input a
Input b
Compute c = a + b
Check and report whether c == a
```

## 01.02.

Design  and  develop  a  program  in  a  language  of  your choice  to  solve  the  triangle problem defined as follows :   
Accept three floats which are supposed to be the three sides  of  triangle  and  determine  if  the three  values  represent  an  equilateral  triangle, isosceles triangle, scalene triangle, or they do not form a triangle at all.   
Derive test cases for your program based on decision-table approach, execute the test cases and discuss the results
